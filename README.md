### 🚀 Key Projects & Research

#### **Systems & Infrastructure (SRE Focus)**
* **Custom Arch Linux Environment & AwesomeWM:** Developed a modular, Lua-based window manager configuration. Optimized kernel parameters for Intel GPU stability and engineered automated script-based system bootstrapping for high-productivity Linux environments.
* **High-Reliability Network Protocol:** Engineered a custom TCP-based data extraction protocol in ANSI C. Implemented ACK/NACK reliability mechanisms and handled high concurrency using `fork()` and `select()`.
* **Distributed Observability Dashboards:** Successfully reduced MTTR by ~15% by building system-wide observability layers using Prometheus and OpenSearch in a distributed environment.

#### **AI & Machine Learning**
* **Medical Image Segmentation (Thesis: 10/10):** Published research on Advanced Endometriosis Detection. Developed a hybrid **U-Net + Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** system achieving **92% accuracy**. Dockerized the inference engine for scalable clinical deployment.
* **LLM Implementation:** Extensive experience with **LangChain** for LLM application development, including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and autonomous agent integration.

#### **Full-Stack & Cloud Native**
* **Multi-Cloud SaaS Platform:** Developed and deployed a recipe platform across **GCP and Azure**, implementing Redis caching for performance and AI-driven text-to-speech integration.
* **Symbolic Differentiation Engine:** Built a **C++20** engine utilizing Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for mathematical simplification and SDL2 for visualization.
