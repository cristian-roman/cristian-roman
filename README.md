## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with experience designing and operating **cloud-native, business-critical systems** in regulated domains (ERP, health insurance).

My work centers on **Java (Spring Boot)** and **.NET**, building reliable microservices with a strong emphasis on **correctness, performance, observability, and long-term maintainability**. I enjoy working on real business problems and taking ownership of systems in production.

Alongside backend engineering, I have a strong **systems and low-level foundation** (network programming, concurrency, Linux) and hands-on experience delivering **applied AI systems** from research to production-ready prototypes.
