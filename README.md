### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with 3+ years of experience building **high-performance, modular backend systems**. I specialize in **concurrency, distributed systems, and low-latency architectures**, with a focus on **efficiency, scalability, and maintainability**.  

I work primarily with **Java, Python, C++, and C#**, leveraging **multithreading, network programming, and cloud-native tools** to deliver robust, high-throughput services.  

I enjoy optimizing systems for **performance and reliability**, automating infrastructure with **Docker, orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines**, and mentoring junior engineers to help them grow.  
Curious by nature, I keep up with **new technologies, programming languages, and system design patterns** to continuously improve the software I build.  

Here you'll find a selection of projects I’ve worked on during my studies and professional experience.
